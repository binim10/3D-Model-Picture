# IME5780
Model of a 3D picture

I built this project as part of an Introduction to Software Engineering course.
During the course, we learned Agile development, Test Driven Design, and SOLID principles.
The construction of the project also made extensive use of the principles of linear algebra to calculate shapes, vectors and rays to create the image.
The project received a score of 100 (and a few more bonus points ðŸ˜‰).
